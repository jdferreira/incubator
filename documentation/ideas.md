# Random ideas and thoughts

This file contains some random ideas that pop up in my mind and that I want to save for the future. These include, for example, ideas for functionality that I'm not sure I want to implement, or thought about the actual incubation algorithm.

## Setting a pet free

I want the release of a pet into the wild to be dissociated from any material cost to the player that chooses to do so (it is &ldquo;free as in beer&rdquo;). This mimics the actual action of setting a pet free into the wild. Likewise, the pet, which may be domesticated to the point of being unable to defend itself alone in the wild, will probably die as a result of this.

While free, this action is unprincipled and criminal. As such, I do want to minimise the behaviour. Otherwise, an unethical player will simply create and destroy pets as long as they want until they get their desired output. It could be argued that the pets are virtual and nothing more than bits in a network of devices; however, as long as it mimics a real foul action it must not be condoned. Thus, there must be some sort of a _moral police_ that controls it.

One idea to implement it is to place a marker into a map, in the actual location where the pet was freed; when several markers exist in the same (or approximate) spot, a (virtual) _covert officer_ is sent to the location and anyone freeing a pet in the vicinity of the said officer is caught and charged with a monetary fine (virtual money). This fine increases in an exponential fashion when the player repeats the infraction, and can elicit other repercussions, such as the inability to buy/sell pets, use laboratories, participate in contests, setting up a kennel, _etc_.

## The womb's attractor field

The womb's attractor field (the three-dimensional field responsible for generating the attractors and repellers to guide the new pet's cells in their development) can be either generated based on the parent's or the embryo's genome. I'd like to see the behaviour of evolution before deciding on either one, although I partly prefer the version where the field is based on the parent's genome, since it more closely reflects the actual biological process (in that all the somatic material in the embryo's first cells &ndash; everything except the actual DNA &ndash; were produced by the mother's egg and thus result from the mother's DNA).
